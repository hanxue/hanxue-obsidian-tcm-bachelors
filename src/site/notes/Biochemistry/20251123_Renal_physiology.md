Transcapillary gradient in protein concentration 跨毛细血管蛋白浓度梯度
Ditribution of fluids between plasma and extravascular spaces is influenced by osmotic pressure gradient of proteins: transcapillary gradient in protein concentration 毛细血管蛋白浓度梯度

Should be noted that protein accounts for <1% of total plasma osmolality. 血漿滲透壓

Extracellular concentration of important ions is derived from venous blood sample

Charge difference between anions and cations is called the anion gap. 
This is due to sulfate, phosphate, proteins and other organic anions not measured in clinical laoratory. 

### Ionic composition of intracellular fluid
- Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> is low 10mmolL<sup>-1</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> is high 150 mmoL<sup>-1</sup>
- Intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> is very low, protines, phosphate and sulphate majority of cations

## Relevant Renal Structure

- There are 2 kidneys, each with an outer cortex 皮质 and inner medulla 髓质.
- Urine is formed inside nephron 尿液在肾单位内形成
- Each nephron contains a glomerulus 肾小球, consisting of a tuft of capillaries + afferent arterioles + efferent arterioles
- 肾小球 = 入球小动脉 + 出球小动脉 + 毛细血管
- Glomerulus is surrounded by epithelium of Bowman's capsule 包曼氏囊上皮, these structures combine to form renal corpuscle
- Initial plasma filtration happens in Bowman's capsule

- Resulting filtrate modified by secretory and reabsortive processes as it passes through the
	- proximal convoluted tubule
	- loop of Henle
	- distal convoluted tubule
	- collecting duct
- 所得滤液 被分泌以及重吸收过程，会通过：
	- 近曲小管
	- 髓袢
	- 远曲小管
	- 集合管

Renal cortex 肾皮质
- glomeruli 肾小球
- proximal, distal convoluted tubule 近曲小管、远曲小管
- loops of Henle, collecting ducts extend to medullary region
- 髓袢和集合管延伸至肾髓质
- Urine, the end product is delivered via renal pelvis 肾盂 to the ureter 输尿管, which empties into the bladder
- 尿液通过肾盂排除到输尿管，一直到膀胱

### Ultrastructural features of nephron
- Walls of each nephron is single layer of epithelial cells 肾单位壁是单层上皮细胞组成
- Podocytes in Bowman's capsule surround the glomerular capillaries and contribute to filtration barrier.
- 肾小球囊的足细胞围绕肾小球毛细血管，组成部分滤过屏障
- Cells lining convoluted tubule carry brush border of microvilli on their luminal surface and contain large numbers of intracellular mitochondria. 
- 远、近曲小管上皮细胞的腔面有一层微绒毛，包含大数量的胞内线粒体
	- Pronounced in proximal convoluted tubule, provide large surface area and rich supplies of ATP, appropriate for a region specializing in active transport.  
	- 近曲小管是主动运输区域，所以微绒毛就有很大面积而且也有丰富的ATP
	- In the descending limb of the loop of Henle, the epithelium is flat, with few organelles. Consistent with low level of active transport, and high permeability to fluid and electrolytes.  
	- 但是髓袢降支的上皮较扁平，也不多细胞器 - 较低的主动运输，较高的液体和电子渗透性
	- Cells is thick portion of ascending limb are more like those in tubules - active ion transport, very low level of permeability to water, probably because of well-developed tight juntions between adjacent epithelial cells
	- 髓袢升支粗段 细胞相似 小管细胞，拥有主动离子转运，很低的水液渗透率，相邻上皮细胞间发育良好的紧密连接

### Blood Supply to the nephron

- Blood supply is delivered via renal artery
- 血液通过肾动脉
- Glomerular capillaries are supplied through afferent arteriole but instead of draining through a venule, it is drained via efferent arteriole. 
- 肾小球毛细血管通过入球小动脉，但是不是通过静脉输出，而是出球小动脉。
- Efferent arteriole --> peritubular capillary beds, vasa recta
- 血液从出球小动脉流到 肾小管周围毛细血管床，直小血管
- Vasa recta -> medulla to supply loops of Henle and collecting ducts
- 直小血管降下到肾髓质，供应髓袢和集合管
-
